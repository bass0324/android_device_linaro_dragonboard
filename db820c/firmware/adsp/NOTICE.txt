 * This file contains 2-pass color quantization (color mapping) routines.
 * These routines provide selection of a custom color map for an image,
 * followed by mapping of the image to that color map, with optional
 * Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
 * It is also possible to use just the second pass to map to an arbitrary
 * externally-given color map.
 *
 * Note: ordered dithering is not supported, since there isn't any fast
 * way to compute intercolor distances; it's unclear that ordered dither's
 * fundamental assumptions even hold with an irregularly spaced color map."

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
 commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
 protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
 The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the
 Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its
 related documentation.

 OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed from Eric A. Young
 and Tim J. Hudson.  The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under a dual-license (the
 OpenSSL license plus the SSLeay license) situation, which basically means
 that you are free to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial
 purposes as long as you fulfill the conditions of both licenses."
